           			<td>Yuuta Okkotsu (Voiced by Megumi Ogata) is haunted. Ever since his childhood friend Rika died in a traffic accident, her ghost has stuck with him. But her spirit does not appear as the sweet girl Yuuta once knew. Instead, she manifests as a monstrous and powerful entity who fiercely protects him. Unable to control Rika's violent behavior, Yuuta is helpless to stop the bloodshed that follows from her brutal vengeance. As a result, when apprehended by "Jujutsu" sorcerers--the secret guardians of the world, trained to combat forces like Rika--Yuuta wishes to be completely isolated so that no one else can get hurt. Yet his apprehender, the master sorcerer Satoru Gojou (Voiced By Yûichi Nakamura), has different plans for him: he will join Jujutsu High School and learn to control Rika in order to help people. Now a first-year at this school, Yuuta starts to learn Jujutsu arts and combat malignant beings. Alongside his new classmates Maki Zenin (Voiced by Mikako Komatsu), a Jujutsu weapons expert; Toge Inumaki (Voiced by Kôki Uchiyama), a spellcaster who uses his words as weapons; and Panda (Voiced by Tomokazu Seki), a seemingly walking and talking panda bear, Yuuta begins to find his place in the world and, for once, to feel comfortable with his abilities. However, as his training progresses, Yuuta comes to learn that the dangers of the Jujutsu world go far beyond that of wicked spirits. Cursed users like Suguru Geto (Voiced by Takahiro Sakurai) and his so-called family attempt to capture the Riko who is now binded to Yuuta.</td>
           			<td>★★★☆ <br><br> "Its a great movie and it had a great theme. Overall its a 4/5, its nothing compared to JJK Season 2. Its asheme that the studio animating this overworks their animators and underpays them but its still overall a great time. Every character gets to shine in this film except for Panda which sucks because he looks so cute."</td>
           		</tr>
           		<tr>
           			<td>The narrative centers on Shôko Nishimiya (Voiced by Saori Hayami), a young elementary school student portrayed with a delicate touch by Saori Hayami, who grapples with hearing impairment. Upon her enrollment in a new school, she becomes the target of relentless bullying from her peers, particularly by Shôya Ishida, voiced by Miyu Irino. The mistreatment escalates to such an extent that Shôko is compelled to change schools, leaving behind a shattered sense of self-worth. Meanwhile, Shôya finds himself isolated and tormented, stripped of companionship and any semblance of a hopeful future. However, as time unfolds, a transformative journey unfolds for Shôya, characterized by profound self-reflection and a determined quest for redemption, culminating in a remarkable tale of personal growth and resilience..</td>
           			<td>★★★★ <br><br>"The movie itself is great and I loved it. It tackled serious themes like disability, bullying and mental health. It tackled them in a way that everyone can understand how it feels to be them for at least a few seconds. Shoko at some point tries to kill herself by jumping off the balcony during a firework show but ends up making her friend fall instead. The way it was shot and the way it was animated was so great. It felt like watching a normal live action movie instead of an animated one.</br></td>

           		<tr>
           			<td>Asta (Voiced by Kajiwara, Gakuto and Fujita, Nao), a boy born with no magic in a world where magic is everything, and his rival Yuno (Voiced by Shimazaki, Nobunaga and Sekine, Arisa), a genius mage chosen by the legendary 4-leaf Grimoire, have together fought a number of powerful enemies to prove their power beyond adversity and aim for the top mage "Wizard King". Standing in front of Asta and Yuno, who dream of becoming the Wizard King, are the Wizard Kings from the past. Conrad Leto, Julius Novachrono's predecessor Wizard King, once respected by the people of Clover Kingdom but suddenly rebelled against the kingdom and was sealed away, has been resurrected. Now he aims to use the "Imperial Sword" to resurrect the 3 most feared Wizard Kings in the history, Edward Avalaché, Princia Funnybunny and Jester Garandaros, and take over the Clover Kingdom.</td>
           			<td>★★☆☆ <br><br>"Its a pretty mid movie, I liked it but I felt like it lacked what made Black Clover good. The movie itself was so boring and didn't have anything unique to it. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and A Silent Voice had more to offer so comparing Black Clover to them is pretty unfair. But still, overall its just a 2 out of 5 star film.</td>
